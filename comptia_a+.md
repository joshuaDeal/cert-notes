		- Control and manage industrual machines
		- Often semented away from rest of network
			- Need to be kept secure
	- Legacy systems
		- "really old"
		- Can also be very important
		- may run on older software and hardware
	- Embeded Systems
		- Purpose-built device
		- No direct access to operating system
		- Common for alarm systems, door security, time card, etc
	- Iot (Internet of Things)
		- Appliances
			- Refrigerators
		- Smart devices
		- Thermostat
		- Access
			- Smart doorbell
		- May also be segmented
			- Security is very important

## 2.5 IPv4 & IPv6
	- IPv4
		- Primary protocol we use for everything
		- Four numbers (bytes) all seperated with '.'
			- Each segment may be called "8 bits", "1 byte", or "1 octet"
				- Four together makes 32 bits aka 4 bytes
			- Max value of 255
		- OSI layer 3 address
		- Networking
			- Every device on a network gets a unique IP adress
			- Subnet mask (255.255.255.0)
				- Used to determine what subnet device is on
				- Not usually trasmitted across network
			- Default gateway
				- Router that allows you to communicate outside of local subnet
				- Must be on local subnet
			
	- IPv6
		- Now a part of all major operating systems
		- Backbone of internet infastructure
		- 128-bit address
			- 128 bits = 16 bytes
		- Stops us from running out of addresses
		- Adress broken into 8 groups sepearated by ':'
			- each group is "16 bits" or "2 bytes" or "2 octets"
		- Longer IP addresses are harder to remember. DNS comes in handy
		- First 64 bits is generally network prefix
		- Last 64 bits is generally network address
	- DNS
		- Names are eaiser to remeber than IP addresses.
		- Routers only know IP addresses
		- This can translate IPs to Domain names
		- Configure two DNS servers in up configuration

### 2.5.1 Assinging IP Addresses
	- IPv4 address configureation used to be manual
	- BOOTP
		- bootstrap protocol
		- October 1993
		- Early means of automaticly managing a network
		- Didn't configure anything
		- Couln't track when a device left network
	- DHCP
		- Initally released in 1997, updates overtime
		- Provides automatic address / IP configurations for almost all devices
		- Process
			- DORA
				- A four-step process
				1. D: Discover
					- Find a DHCP server
					- udp/67 broacast from client to dhcp servers
						- Must use broadcast becasue client has not been given an IP address or been configured
				2. O: Offer
					- Get an offer
					- udp/68 Broadcast from server to client
				3. R: Request
					- Pick an offer
					- Request is made by client to server via udb/67 broadcast
				4. A: Acknowlege
					- DHCP server confirmation
					- upd/68 broadcast from server to client
		- IP address are stored in a pool
			- You may want some devices to have a static ip
				- Disabling DHCP and manually setting IP address can allow this.
				- DHCP alternativly supporst reservations
					- This is done via MAC addresses
	- APIPA (Automatic Private IP Addressing) / Link-local Address
		- When DHCP isn't found
		- Only works in local network
		- EITF has reserver 169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255
		- Assinged automatcily by local device to local device
			- Uses ARP to see if IP is free

## 2.6 DNS Configuration
	- Domain name system
	- Translate human-readable names into computer-readable IP addresses
	- Hierarchical
	- Distrubuted database
	- many dns servers
		- 13 root server cluesters (over 1,000 acutal servers)
	- many generic top-level domains (gTLDs)
		- .com, .org, .net, etc
	- Over 275 country code top-level domians (ccTLDS)
		- .us, .ca, .uk, etc
	- DNS records
		- Resource Records (RR)
			- The database of records or dmain name services
			- Over 30 types
				- IP addresses, certificates, host alias names, etc
		- Address records (A) (AAAA)
			- Defines the IP address of a host
			- A records are for IPv4
			- AAAA records are for IPv6
			- TTL (Time to live)
				- Info from dns server will be stored for this long
		- (MX) Mail Exchanger Record
			- Determines the host name for the mail server
		- Text records (txt)
			- Human readable text information
			- Useful public information
			- Can be used for verification purposes
			- Can be used for email security
		- Sender policy framework (SPF)
			- spf protocol
			- list of servers that are authorized to send emails for a domain
			- Prevent mail spoofing
			- Mail servers preform a check to see if mail really came from host it clames to be from
		- Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM)
			- Digitally sing a domain's outgoing mail
				- Validated by mail server
				- Public key is in the DKIM TXT record
		- DMARC
			- Domain-based message authentication reporting and conformance
			- Prevent unauthorized email use
			- externsion of spf and dkim
			- decied what external email servers should do with emails that don't validate through spf or dkim
	- DNS configuration
		- Text config file
		- Sometimes there are web based front ends

### 2.6.1 DHCP Configuration
	- IP Address range
	- Subnet Masks
	- Lease durations
	- DNS server
	- Default gateway
	- VOIP Settings
	- DHCP Pool
		- Each subnet has its own scope
		- Scope is generally a single contiguous pool of IP Adresses
			- Execptions can be made on server
	- SOHO DHCP server
		- DHCP server may be embeded on a router
	- DHCP adress assignment
		- Dynamic assignments
			- addresses are picked from large pool
			- Addresses are reclaimed after lease period
		- Automatic Assignment
			- DHCP server keeps a list of past assingments
			- Devices are always given the same IP address
	- DHC Adress reservation
		- Manually configerd
		- MAC Addresses are given specific IP Addresses
		- AKA static DHCP Assingment, or DHCP address allocation
	- DHCP leases
		- IP assingments are temporary
		- Allocation
			- Amount of time a lease lasts for
		- Reallocation
			- Leases can be renewed after a device reconnects or reboots
		- Systems can manually relases their ip address when leaving the network
		- T1 timer
			- Checks in w/ DHCP server half way through lease.
		- T2 timer
			- If T1 timer check fails an attempt is made again at 7/8ths of lease time

### 2.6.2 VLANs and VPNs
	- LAN
		- Local Area Network
		- Group of devices in the same broadcast domain
	- Virtual LAN (VLAN)
		- Logicly specific interfaces are for specific networks on a switch
		- Grouping devices in same broadcast domain
		- Spread them logically on one switch instead of physically across multiplu network devices
	- VPN
		- Vurtual Private Network
		- Encrypted data traversing a public network
		- Concentrator
			- encyption/decription done by this device
			- Often integrated into a firewall
		- Many deployment options
			- Can have specialized hardware
			- Software based options exist
		- Client software is sometimes built into the OS
		- Client-to-site VPN
			- On-demand access from a remote device
				- Software connects to a VPN concentrator
				- Uses encrypted tunnels
			- Some software can be configured as always on
